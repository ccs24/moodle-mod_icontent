    ticket is not needed. Did not work as there were no questions on a slide.
20231228 iContent_1146 - pix_url is deprecated. Use image_url for images and pix_icon

20231229 iContent_1148 - Most of the event files need the, protected function

    code to the, function icontent_count_questions_of_questionbank($coursecontext) {,
    that limits the function to only counting questions in the course. Page count now
    appears to be correct and seems work correctly.

1161
20240204 iContent_1186 - Manual review (essay) gives error, String [grade,core] is
    deprecated. The code at toevaluate.php line 100 was pointing to Moodles old string
    for grade. Since iContent does have a grade string, I changed the code to point to
    it, and I also changed the string identifier to gradenoun. I then changed the code
    in the line 100 to use it.
20240204 iContent_1187 - Manual review, after giving rating and saving - Exception...
    In the, icontent/classes/event/question_toevluate_created.php file, I removed the
    two occurances where stdClass was bing used. Manually rating an essay now seems
    to work without any problems.
20240204 iContent_1188 - Text area is too small for essay question answer. Changed the
    class from span12 to col-12 and also added a place holder of, Write essay.

    details. Think I have a little more to do on this.
20240205 iContent_1194bt - Colors and background images do NOT work on old or new pages.
    For colors, I was just doing them wrong by using # in front of the hex number. The
    background images problem was caused by switching from, or, over to using, ||, but
    without isolation the two items with their own parenthesis.
1195
20240208 iContent_1200bt - mdl_icontent... is hardcoded in locallib.php and maybe other
